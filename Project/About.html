                <p>
                    My name is Efren Haskell. I am a Junior in College at Brandeis University.
                    I have around four years of programming experience. I have produced a relatively extensive collection of algorithms and applications.
                <br>
                    Some of which include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A memorization game</li>
                        <li>A tic-tac-toe bot</li>
                        <li>A sudoku-solver</li>
                        <li>etc...</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2 id="colorfulTitle">A brief summary of my coding journey</h2>
                <p>
                    I had an early obsession with creating messaging applications.
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            My first attempt introduced me to socket programming and basic synchronization with multithreading. Before I had figured out how to write web applications and REST APIs, I had been writing front end with Python’s TKinter module for GUI development and implementing back end with TCP servers.<br>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            My second attempt took me through building a program with a Python Flask framework.<br>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Shortly after, I began getting into web development with NodeJS, Html, CSS and SQL. I quickly turned from my flask attempt to a fully non-Python build.<br>
                        </li>
                    </ol><br>
                    Last year, I became painfully aware of how important uploading code to GitHub is, when I woke up one morning to a blue screen, a “critical process failed” message and a no longer functional computer. Since then, I have become exceedingly thorough with my git commits.<br><br>
                    I have recently been largely focused on lower level programming, compiler theory and operating systems development.
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            I recently built a simple kernel in C and Intelx86-compatible assembly.<br>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I have also been working on my own mid-level programming language. I am naming it grumPy, I believe it perfectly captures how I have felt writing it thus far. <br>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I have about a year of experience working with assembly language and I am quite comfortable with Intel x86 asm. However, working through the structure of my ideal programming language and the necessary timeline to producing a language from scratch has been incredibly difficult.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <br>
